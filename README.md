# Dealer Service Xpert

## Description

Dealer Service Xpert is a comprehensive dealer management system designed to streamline the process of managing customer service interactions within an automotive dealership. This application was motivated by the need for an efficient way to track customer interactions, service requests, and advisor performance, ultimately enhancing the customer experience. The project solves the problem of disorganized customer service records and inefficient service advisor management. Through the development of this system, we learned about integrating GraphQL for data querying, implementing secure authentication methods, and designing a user-friendly interface.
